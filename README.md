# J&K EPM

Unofficial android app for the J&K Government Employee Performance Management System [web app](https://epm.jk.gov.in). Built with Java.

## Instructions

<b>Note: Android blocks installation from sources other than the Google Play Store by default. You will need to enable installation from the browser you're using to install the app. [Here](https://www.bestusefultips.com/how-to-install-unknown-apps-on-android-11/) is how you can do it on Android 11.</b>

_Installing the app:_

- Go to the releases section and download the latest apk file named `com.salikkhan.jkepm.apk`. OR [Click this link](https://cdn.salikkhan.com/com.salikkkhan.jkepm.apk) to download it.
- Once downloaded, open the file and install it.
- In case Google gives you a warning, click install anyway.

Once the app is installed you can log in right away.

_Note: Since the official web app doesn't have a way to keep you logged in (cookie-based authentication/JWT etc.), the app doesn't as well. You will have to log in every time you close and reopen the app._
